# psi4meta

Check into this repository the files you use to manage Psi4 that aren't
suitable for distribution in the main repository, whether for reasons of
machine-specificity or rare use or otherwise. Also files that other developers
should be aware of so 'auto-procedures' can be traced.

* Nightly build scripts for the testboard
* Package recipies with build-computer paths
* That script that adds the License text to every file
